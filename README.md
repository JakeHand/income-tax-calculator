# Income Tax Calculator
This income tax calculator allows a single Australian Resident to enter their total taxable income for 2022/23 and receive their estimated total tax for 2022/23.

In this project I learnt how to use a value from one function in another function. I learnt that you must return the desired value in the first function, and call the first function in the second function, retreiving the desired value. I partially understood this before but this project consolidated my understanding.

This project reinforced my understandings of basic Javascript and DOM manipulation. I love numbers so I really enjoyed making this project, which made it super easy to complete.
