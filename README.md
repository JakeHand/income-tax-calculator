# Income Tax Calculator
This income tax calculator allows a single Australian Resident to enter their total taxable income for 2022/23 and receive their estimated total tax for 2022/23.

In this project I learnt how to use a value from one function in another function. I learnt that you must return the desired value in the first function, and call the first function in the second function, retreiving the desired value. I partially understood this before but this project consolidated my understanding.

This project reinforced my understandings of basic Javascript and DOM manipulation, and allowed me to practice and showcase my skills in a more unique program. I love numbers so I really enjoyed making this project, which made it super easy to complete.
